# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending on
#   the platform. Pipfile.lock may vary on different platforms. For example, on Windows CPython sets
#   platoform_system=='Windows' in markers and is checked by some packages.
#   To avoid conflicts it is recommended to add Pipfile.lock to .gitignore.
#   See also: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/598
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The poetry.lock file stores exact versions of dependencies locked by the platform
#   and different platforms may have different dependencies.
#   To avoid conflicts it is recommended to add poetry.lock to .gitignore.
#   See also: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/352#issuecomment-410249925
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#   pdm.lock may vary on different platforms.
#   To avoid conflicts it is recommended to add pdm.lock to .gitignore.
#   See also: https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/usage/lockfile/#lockfile
